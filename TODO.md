Notify is nicer with these:  
 
* Support [INotifyPropertyChanging](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanging.aspx)
* More info in Changed event, e.g. change type, property name etc.
* Integrate with [Memento](http://buunguyen.github.com/memento/)
* Address the known limitations (see Notify.Test/Limitation.cs)
* More samples, e.g. use Notify with objects molded by [NotifyPropertyWeaver](https://github.com/SimonCropp/NotifyPropertyWeaver), [PostSharp](http://www.sharpcrafters.com) etc.
